uberDataAnalysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.

ðŸ“Š Analysis Highlights

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering irrelevant data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Identifying peak ride hours and days.
  - Analyzing ride distribution across different Uber bases.
  - Visualizing monthly trends and ride density.
Statistical Insights:
  - Finding the most active Uber base.

ðŸ“¸ Sample Visualizations

- *Ride Volume Over Time*: A line chart illustrating the fluctuation in the number of rides over different time periods, helping to identify peak demand hours and trends.
- *Hourly Ride Distribution*: A bar chart depicting ride counts across different hours of the day, highlighting peak and off-peak periods for operational insights.
- *Base-wise Ride Count*: A grouped bar chart showing ride distributions across various Uber bases, aiding in identifying the most active operational hubs.
- *Heatmap of Ride Density*: A geographical heatmap displaying ride pickup locations, useful for understanding spatial demand patterns and optimizing service locations.
- *Box Plot of Ride Counts*: A box plot that visualizes ride count distributions across different bases, assisting in detecting anomalies and variations in fleet activity.
